# Kebab Firmware - Snick
A modded firmware source for The Kebab by KeeBot.


The Kebab is an Alice style custom kit made by [KeeBot](https://www.facebook.com/keebotbd)

I got the keyboard and went crazy seeing all the possibilities with the open source vial-qmk firmware the Kebab uses.
This repository contains all the firmware mods I made and will make in the future hopefully.
